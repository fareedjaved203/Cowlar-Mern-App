# Cowlar-Mern-App

It is a Todo List created using Mern Stack

#Download the final two branches:

master
frontend
#To Start:

Start the front using 'npm run dev'
Start the backend using 'nodemon app.js'
Ignore the other branches!

#Features

Add Item to the Database
Delete Item from the Database
Update the status of the Item (pending or completed)
Category wise display showing both completed tasks, pending tasks and all tasks
MongoDB Atlas is used
Backend functionality for the user signup is added (because in the template there was an image that confused me)

#Note: I tried unit testing using Jest, but couldn't perform it properly.
#Note: In Mern-Todo-App repository, everything was committed after each interval, however an issue was occured that is why I had to create a new repository with a single commit only.
